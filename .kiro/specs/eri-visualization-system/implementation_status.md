## ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase: Custom Method Implementation

### Phase 4: Custom Method Implementation (Tasks 11-13)

**Objective:** Implement two advanced continual learning methods that will provide stronger empirical evidence for ERI analysis.

#### Task 11: Enhanced DER++ Method

**Goal:** Implement an advanced replay method with improved buffer management and distillation strategies.

**Key Features:**

- Adaptive buffer management with importance-based sampling
- Dynamic replay ratio based on forgetting detection
- Enhanced distillation loss with temperature scheduling
- Memory-efficient buffer updates with gradient-based selection

**Expected Benefits:**

- Better performance on shortcut learning scenarios
- More nuanced ERI dynamics for visualization
- Stronger empirical evidence for method comparisons

#### Task 12: Adaptive EWC Method

**Goal:** Implement an adaptive regularization method that dynamically adjusts importance weights.

**Key Features:**

- Adaptive lambda scheduling based on task similarity
- Importance decay for older tasks to prevent over-regularization
- Fisher information matrix updates with momentum
- Task-specific regularization strength adjustment

**Expected Benefits:**

- Improved handling of task transitions
- Better balance between stability and plasticity
- Enhanced ERI metrics showing adaptive behavior

#### Task 13: Custom Method Registry

**Goal:** Create a system for easy integration and management of custom methods.

**Key Features:**

- Automatic method discovery and registration
- Configuration-based method instantiation
- Method metadata and documentation system
- Seamless integration with existing Mammoth infrastructure

**Expected Benefits:**

- Easy addition of future custom methods
- Consistent configuration and evaluation protocols
- Maintainable and extensible codebase

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Approach for Custom Methods

### 1. Method Architecture

Each custom method will:

- Inherit from Mammoth's `ContinualModel` base class
- Integrate seamlessly with existing `EinstellungEvaluator`
- Support all required evaluation splits automatically
- Include comprehensive configuration options

### 2. Configuration Management

```yaml
# experiments/configs/custom_methods.yaml
enhanced_derpp:
  base_class: "EnhancedDerppModel"
  parameters:
    buffer_size: 1000
    alpha: 0.2
    beta: 0.7
    adaptive_sampling: true
    importance_threshold: 0.1
  description: "Enhanced DER++ with adaptive buffer management"

adaptive_ewc:
  base_class: "AdaptiveEwcModel"
  parameters:
    e_lambda: 2000
    adaptive_lambda: true
    importance_decay: 0.95
    momentum: 0.9
  description: "Adaptive EWC with dynamic importance weighting"
```

### 3. Integration Testing

Each method will be tested with:

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with EinstellungEvaluator
- End-to-end pipeline tests with visualization generation
- Performance benchmarks on CIFAR-100 Einstellung dataset

## ðŸ“Š Expected Impact

### Enhanced Empirical Coverage

- **More Methods:** From 3 baseline methods to 5+ including custom implementations
- **Better Dynamics:** Advanced methods should show more interesting ERI patterns
- **Stronger Evidence:** Custom methods designed specifically for shortcut learning scenarios

### Improved Visualizations

- **Richer Heatmaps:** More methods provide better sensitivity analysis
- **Dynamic Patterns:** Advanced methods should show distinct adaptation patterns
- **Method Comparisons:** Clear differentiation between naive, regularization, and replay approaches

### Research Contributions

- **Novel Methods:** Two new continual learning methods with ERI-specific optimizations
- **Evaluation Framework:** Comprehensive system for evaluating continual learning on shortcut scenarios
- **Reproducible Pipeline:** Complete system for generating publication-ready ERI analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for Phase 4

   - Shows improved performance on shortcut learning scenarios
   - Generates distinct ERI dynamics in visualizations

2. **Adaptive EWC Implementation:**

   - Demonstrates adaptive regularization behavior
   - Provides better stability-plasticity trade-offs
   - Shows interesting adaptation delay patterns

3. **Method Registry System:**

   - Enables easy addition of new methods
   - Maintains consistent evaluation protocols
   - Supports configuration-driven experimentation

4. **End-to-End Validation:**
   - All methods work with existing `run_einstellung_experiment.py`
   - Generate publication-ready visualizations automatically
   - Provide comprehensive ERI analysis across all methods

## ðŸš€ Ready to Proceed

The foundation is solid and the integration is working. The next phase focuses on implementing the two custom methods that will significantly enhance the empirical coverage and provide more compelling evidence for ERI analysis.
