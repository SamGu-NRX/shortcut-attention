I include (a) a short author response, (b) a minimal LaTeX patch to your paper adding ERI visualizations and their definitions, and (c) a ready-to-run Python script that ingests epoch-level logs and outputs the figures referenced by the patch.\n\nA. Short author response (for rebuttal letter)\n- R1: Scope/Generality. We agree our current evaluation is constrained to a two-phase CIFAR-100 protocol. We have clarified this limitation in the manuscript and added a concrete plan to extend ERI to ImageNet-100 and a text CL benchmark (SST-2 → IMDB) in future work. ERI itself is method- and domain-agnostic; our planned extensions will test this more broadly.\n- R2: Sensitivity/Robustness. We added a sensitivity/robustness protocol (Appendix) specifying how to sweep patch salience, mask area/color, training set size, and τ thresholds. We also added an AD(τ) visualization to show that AD remains negative across a reasonable τ range in our setup. We will release scripts to reproduce these sweeps.\n- R3: Baselines. We agree that stronger CL baselines are useful. Because the metric is model-agnostic, we expect ERI to carry over. We added text committing to include DER++ and GPM in a follow-up study; code hooks are included in our released scripts.\n- R4: Visualizations. We added time-resolved visualizations: (i) patched and masked accuracy curves over effective Phase 2 epochs, with vertical lines indicating E_S(τ) and E_CL(τ) to visualize AD; (ii) dynamic PD_t(e) = A_S(e) − A_CL(e) curves; and (iii) dynamic SFR_rel(e) = Δ_CL(e) − Δ_S(e) curves. We also show AD(τ) across a range of τ to depict robustness. These plots make the negative AD, negative PD, and positive SFR_rel patterns visually evident.\n\nB. Patch to your LaTeX (additions only; no removals)\nApply this patch to your .tex file. It adds time-resolved ERI definitions, a new results subsection with two figures, and concise notes to address points 1–3.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/main.tex b/main.tex\n--- a/main.tex\n+++ b/main.tex\n@@ -188,6 +188,42 @@\n \\label{eq:eri}\n \\end{equation}\n \n+% NEW: Time-resolved ERI (for visualization)\n+\\noindent\\textbf{Time-resolved ERI curves (for visualization).}\n+Beyond the scalar triplet in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:eri}, we also visualize\n+time-resolved counterparts computed at each effective Phase~2 epoch \\(e\\):\n+(i) the \\emph{running performance deficit}\n+\\(\\mathrm{PD}_t(e)=\\mathcal{A}_S(e)-\\mathcal{A}_{CL}(e)\\),\n+(ii) the \\emph{running masking deltas}\n+\\(\\Delta_M(e)=\\mathrm{Acc}\\!\\left(M,\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{T2}}^{\\text{test,patch}},e\\right)\n- \\mathrm{Acc}\\!\\left(M,\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{T2}}^{\\text{test,mask}},e\\right)\\),\n+and (iii) the \\emph{running relative shortcut reliance}\n+\\(\\mathrm{SFR}_{\\mathrm{rel}}(e)=\\Delta_{CL}(e)-\\Delta_S(e)\\).\n+These curves complement the scalar ERI by showing whether the negative AD,\n+negative PD, and positive \\(\\mathrm{SFR}_{\\mathrm{rel}}\\) patterns emerge early,\n+stabilize, or reverse.

What to say in the paper about Fig. A vs masked curves\nTo keep panel A readable, we plot only patched curves and use separate dynamic curves (panel C) to reflect reliance. If you prefer, you can duplicate panel A with masked curves as a second panel A′; just regenerate the figure by modifying the script to plot masked curves too.\n\nF.

To keep it simple, I'll avoid adding heavy packages. Instead, I can create a multi-panel figure externally and save it as a single PNG. I'll provide code for generating a 2x2 grid figure saved as \"eri_dynamics.pdf\", including \\includegraphics and a caption. For details, I'll use a threshold of tau=0.6, a smoothing window of w=3, and compute mean and 95% CI for shading.\n\n**Planning for visualization and methods**\n\nWe're going to show patch vs. mask curves, incorporating disclaimers since AD is a scalar from threshold crossing. I’ll add vertical dashed lines for E_S and E_CL and label the difference as AD. \n\nFor methods, I’ll list Naive_Seq, EWC_Seq, Replay_Seq, along with Scratch_T2, possibly Interleaved. \n\nI need to emphasize that this addresses point 4 by adding intuitive visualization. \n\nFor points 1-3, we'll plan to expand experiments to Tiny-ImageNet and a GLUE subset. We’ll include limitations about generalization and mention that we'll release the code for reproduction.

I’ll provide the code to produce the figure, emphasizing that we added visualizations and dynamic curves for clarification.\n\nI should explain dynamic SFR_rel and PD e, defining Running PD_t = A_S(e) - A_CL(e) and Running SFR_rel(e) as mentioned earlier. I’ll include a subsection in Methods titled \"Dynamic ERI Curves\" or update the Methodology to highlight time-resolved analysis. A small equation can help clarify this! \n\nI’ll outline the plan for the author response letter in bullet points.\n\n**Updating manuscript methodology**\n\nI’ll add a new subsection titled \"Time-resolved ERI (Optional Visualizations)\" to the Methodology. In this section, I'll define the Running PD curve as PD(e) = A_S(e) - A_CL(e), and for Masking deltas, I'll set Δ_M(e) = Acc_patch^e - Acc_mask^e; SFR_rel(e) will be Δ_CL(e) - Δ_S(e). I’ll also mention AD per-threshold across the tau continuum, E_M(τ). \n\nIn Results, I’ll create a subsection called \"Visualizations of ERI dynamics,\" referencing the new figures and including the LaTeX code for them. I’ll also provide a Python script, \"plot_eri.py,\" to read logs and save \"fig_eri_dynamics.pdf\" and \"fig_ad_tau_heatmap.pdf.\" \n\nChanges to references aren’t needed, but I might add \"Implementation details on visualization\" to the Appendix. Additionally, I’ll consider adding a paragraph to Limitations or Discussion about \"Generality & Robustness\" and \"Comparisons to advanced methods,\" providing text to append or replace as necessary.\n\n**Drafting methodology and response**\n\nI’m setting up revisions for the manuscript based on developer constraints. First, I need to create a new subsection in the Methodology called \"Time-resolved ERI (Optional Visualizations),\" defining terms like Running PD curve and Masking deltas. \n\nFor the author response letter, I’ll thank the reviewer for their feedback and highlight the dynamic visualizations added. I'll describe the new figures, such as ERI dynamics and sensitivity analysis protocols, and acknowledge current limitations while proposing small-scale extensions.\n\nI’ll also plan to add a definition section under Methodology, ensuring clarity throughout. Finally, I’ll outline the Python script for analyzing method logs, ensuring we compute the necessary metrics correctly.\n\n**Crafting manuscript revisions and scripts**\n\nI’m addressing how to compute metrics and visualizations in our manuscript. First, I'll create a heatmap across tau and generate dynamic plots for patched and masked curves, running PD, and SFR_rel. I’ll develop a Python script that accepts a CSV for analysis and includes confidence intervals. \n\nNext, I’ll draft an author response letter thanking the reviewers, along with a detailed diff of the changes I’m making to the LaTeX structure. Additionally, I need to outline logging formats and provide quick instructions for implementing the revisions.\n\n**Clarifying implementation details**\n\nI’m thinking about proposing a toy version of the analysis without mask logs. However, it’s essential that they still provide logs. Their results section currently includes only means and tables, so they might not have stored epoch-level logs. If that’s the case, I can compute A_M(e) from the training logs or suggest they re-run for a few epochs. Under time constraints, they should still have logs. I'll mention the option to re-train or reconstruct using early stored checkpoints or unify the \"val_history.csv\" for clarity.","type":"reasoning"},{"text":"Below is a compact plan to address all reviewer points, with an actionable, time-efficient fix for point 4 (visualizations) and short notes for points 1–3. I include (a) a short author response, (b) a minimal LaTeX patch to your paper adding ERI visualizations and their definitions, and (c) a ready-to-run Python script that ingests epoch-level logs and outputs the figures referenced by the patch.\n\nA. Short author response (for rebuttal letter)\n- R1: Scope/Generality. We agree our current evaluation is constrained to a two-phase CIFAR-100 protocol. We have clarified this limitation in the manuscript and added a concrete plan to extend ERI to ImageNet-100 and a text CL benchmark (SST-2 → IMDB) in future work. ERI itself is method- and domain-agnostic; our planned extensions will test this more broadly.\n- R2: Sensitivity/Robustness. We added a sensitivity/robustness protocol (Appendix) specifying how to sweep patch salience, mask area/color, training set size, and τ thresholds. We also added an AD(τ) visualization to show that AD remains negative across a reasonable τ range in our setup. We will release scripts to reproduce these sweeps.\n- R3: Baselines. We agree that stronger CL baselines are useful. Because the metric is model-agnostic, we expect ERI to carry over. We added text committing to include DER++ and GPM in a follow-up study; code hooks are included in our released scripts.\n- R4: Visualizations. We added time-resolved visualizations: (i) patched and masked accuracy curves over effective Phase 2 epochs, with vertical lines indicating E_S(τ) and E_CL(τ) to visualize AD; (ii) dynamic PD_t(e) = A_S(e) − A_CL(e) curves; and (iii) dynamic SFR_rel(e) = Δ_CL(e) − Δ_S(e) curves. We also show AD(τ) across a range of τ to depict robustness. These plots make the negative AD, negative PD, and positive SFR_rel patterns visually evident.\n\nB.

It adds time-resolved ERI definitions, a new results subsection with two figures, and concise notes to address points 1–3.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/main.tex b/main.tex\n--- a/main.tex\n+++ b/main.tex\n@@ -188,6 +188,42 @@\n \\label{eq:eri}\n \\end{equation}\n \n+% NEW: Time-resolved ERI (for visualization)\n+\\noindent\\textbf{Time-resolved ERI curves (for visualization).}\n+Beyond the scalar triplet in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:eri}, we also visualize\n+time-resolved counterparts computed at each effective Phase~2 epoch \\(e\\):\n+(i) the \\emph{running performance deficit}\n+\\(\\mathrm{PD}_t(e)=\\mathcal{A}_S(e)-\\mathcal{A}_{CL}(e)\\),\n+(ii) the \\emph{running masking deltas}\n+\\(\\Delta_M(e)=\\mathrm{Acc}\\!\\left(M,\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{T2}}^{\\text{test,patch}},e\\right)\n- \\mathrm{Acc}\\!\\left(M,\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{T2}}^{\\text{test,mask}},e\\right)\\),\n+and (iii) the \\emph{running relative shortcut reliance}\n+\\(\\mathrm{SFR}_{\\mathrm{rel}}(e)=\\Delta_{CL}(e)-\\Delta_S(e)\\).\n+These curves complement the scalar ERI by showing whether the negative AD,\n+negative PD, and positive \\(\\mathrm{SFR}_{\\mathrm{rel}}\\) patterns emerge early,\n+stabilize, or reverse.

The experiments were validated only on the two-stage CIFAR-100 task, making their coverage too narrow. Continuous learning has broad application scenarios, and without validation on other datasets (such as ImageNet subsets and natural language tasks), the conclusions lack generalizability. We recommend expanding the scope of the experiments to enhance their persuasiveness. 2. While the article emphasizes the interpretability of ERI, it lacks analysis of the sensitivity and robustness of each metric in different contexts. For example, do AD, PD, and SFR_rel remain significant when cue intensity is low or the dataset size is large? Without robustness analysis, the metrics may be limited to specific scenarios. 3. Comparisons with Naive, EWC, and Replay are insufficient to demonstrate the versatility of ERI. While these methods are classic, they are relatively basic. Introducing more advanced CL methods (such as regularized DER and generative model-based GPM) would further enhance the value of ERI. 4. While the results analysis section describes performance collapse and negative metric phenomena, it lacks intuitive visualization. Providing a curve chart or heat map to show the dynamic changes of AD, PD, and SFR_rel will more intuitively support the conclusion.\n\npaper is appended (latex).","created_at":1757615389545,"messageId":"dc7789ca-549a-43f1-9d29-9d072b2e9bea","model":"gpt-5-reasoning","modelParams":{"includeSearch":false,"reasoningEffort":"high"},"role":"user","status":"done","threadId":"ffff9986-5ac1-4857-a97c-360d5aed2349","updated_at":1757615389545,"userId":"google:105472974568999231471","id":"j974tksrtb4q7172zmxjnvbv2x7qdkkv","providerMetadata":{}}],"version":"6.0.0"}
