# ERI Test Methodology for IEEE Research Standards

## Overview

This document describes the testing methodology for the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI) implementation, designed to meet IEEE research publication standards. The test suite ensures:

1. **Rigor**: Comprehensive coverage of edge cases, boundary conditions, and mathematical properties
2. **Reproducibility**: Deterministic behavior and numerical stability
3. **Explainability**: Clear rationale and mathematical justification for each test
4. **Research Validity**: Correct implementation of theoretical definitions from the paper

## Test Organization

### 1. Core Calculation Tests (`test_calculation_fixes.py`)

#### 1.1 Trailing Smoothing Tests
**Purpose**: Validate correct implementation of trailing moving average smoothing.

**Mathematical Basis**: 
```
smoothed_A[e] = mean(A_M[max(0, e-w+1) .. e])
```

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_trailing_smoothing_basic`: Validates window-based averaging with known inputs
- `test_trailing_smoothing_window_1`: Edge case where window=1 should return original values
- `test_trailing_smoothing_paper_example`: Validates against paper-specified examples

**Rationale**: Smoothing is critical for threshold detection in noisy training curves. Incorrect smoothing can lead to false threshold crossings or missed convergence.

#### 1.2 Threshold Crossing Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure accurate detection of when smoothed accuracy crosses the threshold τ.

**Mathematical Basis**:
```
E_M(τ) = smallest effective epoch e where smoothed_A_M(e) ≥ τ
```

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_threshold_crossing_basic`: Standard threshold crossing detection
- `test_threshold_crossing_censored`: Handling of runs that never cross threshold

**Rationale**: Threshold crossing determines Adaptation Delay. Errors here propagate to final ERI scores and method rankings.

#### 1.3 Adaptation Delay Tests
**Purpose**: Validate AD computation as the difference in threshold crossing epochs.

**Mathematical Basis**:
```
AD = E_CL(τ) - E_S(τ)
```

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_adaptation_delay_basic`: Positive AD (CL slower than scratch)
- `test_adaptation_delay_censored`: Handling when threshold never reached
- `test_adaptation_delay_with_negative_values`: Negative AD (CL faster than scratch)

**Rationale**: Negative AD is a key research finding indicating CL methods can adapt faster than scratch. Must be computed correctly to avoid misinterpretation.

#### 1.4 Final Checkpoint Metrics Tests
**Purpose**: Validate PD and SFR_rel computation from final checkpoint accuracies.

**Mathematical Basis**:
```
PD = A_S_patch^* - A_CL_patch^*
SFR_rel = Δ_CL - Δ_S
where Δ_M = A_M_patch^* - A_M_mask^*
```

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_final_checkpoint_accuracy`: Correct retrieval of final epoch accuracy
- `test_performance_deficit_calculation`: PD computation from final checkpoints
- `test_sfr_rel_calculation`: SFR_rel decomposition validation

**Rationale**: Paper specifies using final checkpoints, not time-series averages. This is a critical correction from earlier implementations.

### 2. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions (`TestEdgeCasesAndBoundaryConditions`)

**Purpose**: Ensure robust handling of unusual but valid experimental scenarios.

**IEEE Research Standard**: Research code must handle edge cases gracefully without crashes or silent failures.

**Test Coverage**:
- **Empty arrays**: Data filtering may result in empty subsets
- **Single values**: Highly filtered data or single-epoch experiments
- **Exact boundaries**: Accuracy exactly equals threshold (A = τ)
- **Plateaus**: Training stalls near threshold before crossing
- **Identical performance**: Methods achieve exactly same accuracy
- **Zero deltas**: No shortcut effect detected (patch = masked)

**Rationale**: Real experiments produce edge cases. Publication-quality code must handle these without manual intervention or data cleaning.

### 3. Numerical Stability Tests (`TestNumericalStability`)

**Purpose**: Ensure calculations remain stable across wide range of input values.

**IEEE Research Standard**: Numerical stability is essential for reproducibility across different hardware and implementations.

**Test Coverage**:
- **Extreme values**: Near-zero and near-one accuracies
- **Noisy data**: Realistic training curves with stochasticity
- **Composite score bounds**: Scores remain in [0,1] range
- **Variance reduction**: Smoothing reduces variance while preserving trend

**Rationale**: Different random seeds, hardware, or hyperparameters can produce extreme values. Calculations must remain stable and interpretable.

### 4. Input Validation Tests (`TestInputValidation`)

**Purpose**: Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs.

**IEEE Research Standard**: Clear error reporting aids debugging and prevents silent failures.

**Test Coverage**:
- **Invalid τ values**: Must be in [0,1] range
- **Invalid window sizes**: Must be positive integers
- **Mismatched array lengths**: Data integrity checks

**Rationale**: Invalid inputs indicate programming errors. Early detection with clear messages reduces debugging time.

### 5. Mathematical Property Tests (`TestMathematicalProperties`)

**Purpose**: Validate theoretical properties of ERI metrics.

**Mathematical Basis**:
- **Antisymmetry**: PD(A,B) = -PD(B,A) and SFR_rel(A,B) = -SFR_rel(B,A)
- **Decomposition**: SFR_rel = Δ_CL - Δ_S

**Test Coverage**:
- `test_pd_antisymmetry`: PD changes sign when methods swapped
- `test_sfr_rel_antisymmetry`: SFR_rel changes sign when methods swapped
- `test_delta_decomposition`: SFR_rel correctly decomposes into deltas

**Rationale**: These properties follow from mathematical definitions. Violations indicate implementation errors.

### 6. Statistical Robustness Tests (`TestStatisticalRobustness`)

**Purpose**: Ensure statistical aggregation follows established theory.

**IEEE Research Standard**: Statistical analysis must follow standard methods (e.g., confidence intervals, outlier handling).

**Test Coverage**:
- **Confidence interval scaling**: SE decreases with √n
- **Censored runs**: Excluded from means but counted
- **Outliers**: Large CI when outliers present
- **Weight consistency**: Rankings stable across reasonable weight configs
- **Zero variance**: Handles deterministic results correctly

**Rationale**: IEEE papers require rigorous statistics. These tests ensure aggregation methods are theoretically sound.

### 7. Research Interpretability Tests (`TestResearchInterpretability`)

**Purpose**: Ensure results provide meaningful insights for research communication.

**IEEE Research Standard**: Results must be interpretable and align with theoretical predictions.

**Test Coverage**:
- **Method ranking consistency**: Rankings match expected rigidity ordering
- **Component contributions**: Identifies dominant rigidity factors
- **Negative metric interpretation**: Correctly handles outperformance
- **Report completeness**: All essential information included

**Rationale**: Research papers require clear interpretation. These tests ensure visualizations and reports communicate findings accurately.

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all ERI tests
pytest tests/eri_vis/ -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/eri_vis/test_calculation_fixes.py::TestEdgeCasesAndBoundaryConditions -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/eri_vis/ --cov=eri_vis --cov-report=html
```

### Test Maintenance

1. **When adding new metrics**: Add corresponding edge case, numerical stability, and validation tests
2. **When modifying calculations**: Update mathematical basis documentation and affected tests
3. **When finding bugs**: Add regression test before fixing
4. **Before paper submission**: Run full test suite with `-v` flag and review output

### Continuous Integration

Tests should run automatically on:
- Every commit to main branch
- Every pull request
- Before creating release tags
- Nightly builds for long-running tests

### Test Data

- **Synthetic data**: Used for most tests to ensure known ground truth
- **Real experimental data**: Used for validation tests (when available)
- **Extreme values**: Deliberately test boundary conditions
- **Random seeds**: Fixed (seed=42) for reproducibility

## Mathematical Notation Reference

- **τ (tau)**: Accuracy threshold for adaptation delay (typically 0.6)
- **A_M**: Accuracy of method M
- **E_M(τ)**: Epoch where method M crosses threshold τ
- **A_M^***: Final checkpoint accuracy for method M
- **Δ_M**: Delta (difference between patch and masked accuracy)
- **w**: Smoothing window size (typically 3)
