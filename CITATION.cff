abstract: >
  This repository implements the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a diagnostic
  framework for detecting shortcut-induced rigidity in continual learning systems.
  Building upon the Mammoth continual learning framework, it provides tools to
  measure adaptation delay, performance deficit, and shortcut feature reliance
  when models encounter spurious correlations across sequential tasks.
