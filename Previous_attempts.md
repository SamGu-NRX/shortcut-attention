Mammoth Einstellung/ViT Integration: Edit Log and Next Steps
Edits Made
1. Debug Logging
Added detailed debug logging to:
Einstellung integration activation points.
ViT model forward passes, especially when return_attention_scores=True.
Experiment runner and argument parsing.
Dataset instantiation and compatibility checks.
2. Attention Extraction Optimization
Limited attention extraction for ViT models to:
Every 5th epoch (instead of every epoch).
Only 3 key layers and 3 heads per analysis.
Capped batch size for attention analysis.
Added explicit memory cleanup after attention extraction.
3. Dataset Compatibility
Ensured all required attributes (e.g., joint) are present in the experiment args Namespace for dataset instantiation.
Patched dataset instantiation logic to avoid missing-attribute errors.
4. Checkpoint Handling
Fixed the --savecheck argument to use valid values (last or task), not a directory path.
Ensured checkpoint saving and loading works as intended for Einstellung experiments.
5. Training Flow and Output
Added a debug mode (--debug_mode 1) to enable fast, smoke-test runs with reduced epochs and batch size.
Enabled real-time output streaming for progress bars and logs.
Safeguarded metrics extraction to handle cases where result.stdout is None due to live output streaming.
6. Testing and Diagnostics
Created a comprehensive debug test script (test_vit_einstellung_debug.py) to verify:
Einstellung integration activation.
Attention extraction and analysis.
Dataset compatibility with ViT backbones.
End-to-end experiment flow.
7. Output Parsing
Updated metrics parsing logic to handle both streamed and captured output, preventing crashes if output is not available in result.stdout.
